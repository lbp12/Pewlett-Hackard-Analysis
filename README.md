# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
In this assignment I looked at the upcoming retirees per title to prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami". I also reviewed which employees will now be eligable for the mentorship program.

## Results
Some of the major takeaways from the information gathered:
  - About 70% of the upcoming retirees hold Senior titles this is illistrated in Table 1 below.
  - In total about 24% of the company is preparing to retire.
  - Only 1549 employees will be eligible to be a part of the mentorship program.
  - There will still be 227566 total employees at Pewlett Hackard, so they may need to relax some of the eligibility requirements depending on how many new associates    are interesed in this program.
